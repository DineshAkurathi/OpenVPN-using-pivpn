# OpenVPN-using-pivpn

The project "OpenVPN-using-pivpn" is centered around setting up a secure and private Virtual Private Network (VPN) by using the PiVPN software on a Raspberry Pi device. PiVPN is a user-friendly VPN software specifically tailored for Raspberry Pi devices, enabling users to configure client devices to connect to the OpenVPN server set up on their Raspberry Pi.

The project entails installing and configuring the PiVPN software on a Raspberry Pi, creating user accounts, and configuring client devices to connect to the VPN. After successful setup, users can securely access their home network from remote locations, protect their online privacy and security, and access the internet through the VPN.

To further enhance the security of the VPN, additional security features, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, may also be configured as part of the project. Overall, the OpenVPN-using-pivpn project offers an excellent opportunity to learn about VPNs and network security while creating a private and secure network for personal or business use.
